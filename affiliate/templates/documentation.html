<p><h3><b>Summary ‚úå<hr></b></h3> of this app was built using the latest and greatest technologies out today. I choose to built it in <b>Django</b> because <b>instagram</b>,<b>reddit</b>,<b>youtube</b>,<b>dropbox</b>,<b>mozilla</b>, <b>pinterest</b> uses <i><b>Django</b></i> which is one kind of <b>blogging</b> and photo sharing app with impecceable load times. I <b>choose</b> to use <b>Reddit</b> as my single state handler because of its overall clean and <b>effective</b> way of handling the state of the application especially for scaling it larger. I chose Django because well, I love using it. It takes away the layer that other task runners like Gulp and Grunt and to projects. I didn't build out the server file till I needed to launch it on <b>Subdomain</b>. I went with <b>Django Development server</b>. I deployed it on subdomain for your viewing pleasure.</p>
